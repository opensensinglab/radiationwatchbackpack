External signal analysis backpack for the Radiation Watch Type 5 high-energy particle detector
======

Work-in-progress.  Please use at your own risk. <br>

This is a board intended to function as an external comparator for the Radiation Watch Type 5 high energy particle detector.  The stock RWT5 comes with a comparator whose threshold appears very conservative, and it appears that lower-energy particles can be detected by affixing an external comparator such as this.  This project is also working towards including an energy-level detection mechanism. <br>

Earlier versions of this backpack were used for the Open Source Desktop Computed Tomography Scanner (OpenCT, http://www.tricorderproject.org/blog/tag/openct/), and the Arducoder Mini open-source science tricorder-like device ( https://hackaday.io/project/1395-open-source-science-tricorder ).
